# laravel-mongo
Convenience library for working with MongoDB documents in Laravel and Lumen.

This library is built on top of [the official MongoDB PHP library](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library) and includes an abstract model, a helper class for handling bulk writes, database wrappers for Laravel and Lumen, and some necessary helper functions.

Please note that this library does *not* extend Eloquent, as Eloquent is designed and written for SQL databases.

## Installation
In order to install this library, issue the following command from your Laravel or Lumen project's root folder:

```
composer require "lindelius/laravel-mongo=^0.3"
```

After installing the library, configure your database connection by adding the following array to the `config/database.php` file (for Lumen installations you will first have to create the _config_ directory yourself and then copy the `database.php` file from `vendor/laravel/lumen-framework/config/`). You will also have to add the `DB_AUTHSOURCE` and `DB_RSNAME` variables to the environment file, if you'd like to override those values.

```php
'mongodb' => [
    'driver'        => 'mongodb',
    'hosts'         => env('DB_HOST', 'localhost:27017'),
    'database'      => env('DB_DATABASE', 'test'),
    'username'      => env('DB_USERNAME', ''),
    'password'      => env('DB_PASSWORD', ''),
    'uriOptions'    => [
        'authSource' => env('DB_AUTHSOURCE', 'admin'),
        'replicaSet' => empty(env('DB_RSNAME')) ? null : env('DB_RSNAME', 'rs1'),
    ],
    'driverOptions' => [],
],
```

### Laravel
For Laravel installations, add the included service provider to the _providers_ array in the `config/app.php` file.

```php
Lindelius\LaravelMongo\MongoDbServiceProvider::class,
```

### Lumen
For Lumen installations, add the included service provider to the `bootstrap/app.php` file.

```php
$app->register(Lindelius\LaravelMongo\MongoDbServiceProvider::class);
```

## Usage

### Database Connector
The database connector can be used by its own after configuring the connection (see the installation instructions). Via the connector you can resolve `MongoDB\Client`, `MongoDB\Database` and `MongoDB\Collection` instances out of the application container.

```php
/**
 * @var Lindelius\LaravelMongo\MongoDbConnection $connection
 */
$connection = app('db');

/**
 * @var MongoDB\Client     $client
 * @var MongoDB\Database   $database
 * @var MongoDB\Collection $collection
 */
$client     = $connection->getClient();
$database   = $connection->getDatabase();
$collection = $connection->getCollection('collection_name');
```

### Bulk Builder
The bulk builder is designed to make it incredibly easy to update multiple objects that extend the `Model` class. All you have to do is create a `BulkBuilder` instance and add the objects to it using the `BulkBuilder::add()` method. The bulk builder will automatically select the collection that is associated with the first object that is added, and then execute the write operations on that collection when the `BulkBuilder::execute()` method is called.

```php
$bulk  = new BulkBuilder();

foreach ($jedis as $jedi) {
    $bulk->add($jedi);
}

/**
 * @var MongoDB\BulkWriteResult $result
 */
$result = $bulk->execute();
```

The class also includes helper functions for adding custom write operations (i.e. operations that aren't taken directly from a `Model` object). These operations can be added to the bulk using the `BulkBuilder::deleteMany()`, `BulkBuilder::deleteOne()`, `BulkBuilder::insertOne()`, `BulkBuilder::replaceOne()`, `BulkBuilder::updateMany()`, and `BulkBuilder::updateOne()` methods. In this case you will have to manually inject the collection into the `BulkBuilder`, either via its constructor or via the `BulkBuilder::setCollection()` method.

```php
$bulk = new BulkBuilder($collection);

foreach ($jedis as $jedi) {
    $bulk->insertOne(['name' => $jedi->name]);
}

$bulk->execute();
```

### Abstract Model
Like previously mentioned, this library also includes an abstract model that you may use as a base class for your MongoDB-backed object models.

```php
use Lindelius\LaravelMongo\Model;

/**
 * Class Jedi
 *
 * @property string $name
 */
class Jedi extends Model
{
    /**
     * The name of the database collection.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected static $collectionName = 'jedi';
}

```

After having extended the `Model` class and added the necessary properties (`Model::$collectionName`) we can now manage our Jedis with ease.

```php
$jedi = new Jedi();
$jedi->name = 'Anakin Skywalker';

if ($jedi->save()) {
    echo 'Uh, I think we just made a horrible decision...';
} else {
    echo 'We failed to teach ' . $jedi->name . ' to use the Force.';
    echo 'Oh, well. It was probably for the better.';
}
```

As you can see in the example above the abstract `Model` class overrides the magic `__get()` and `__set()` methods, allowing you to assign and access the object's field values just like if they were regular public properties.

#### Instance Methods

##### delete
The `Model::delete()` method allows you to delete the object from the database. When successfully called, the `_id` field along with the automatic timestamp fields (if used) will be unset from the object. All other properties will still be available on the object, and they will also be prepared as "updates" in case you would want to save the object again.

```php
$masterYoda = new Jedi('Yoda');

// Approximately 900 years later...

if ($masterYoda->delete()) {
    echo 'RIP ' . $masterYoda->name . ' :(';
}
```

If you have set `Model::$softDeletes` to `true` for this model, the field `deleted_at` will be set to the current time instead of the object being actually deleted from the database. If you use this option you can have entities deleted as far as the application knows, but still keep the data in the database in case you need to restore it later on.

If you wish to hard delete an object that is using soft deletes, you can do so by passing `true` as a parameter to the `delete()` method.

```php
if ($objectUsingSoftDeletes->delete(true)) {
    echo 'The object has now been deleted from the database.';
}
```

##### isDeleted
This convenience method checks whether the object has been "soft" deleted. In order to use soft deletes you have to override the `Model::$softDeletes` property and set it to `true`.

##### isPersisted
This convenience method checks whether the object has been previously saved to the database.

##### restore
The `Model::restore()` method restores the object if it has previously been "soft" deleted.

```php
if ($objectUsingSoftDeletes->delete()) {
    echo 'The object has been soft deleted.';
    
    if ($objectUsingSoftDeletes->restore()) {
        echo 'The object has been restored.';
    }
}
```

Do note, though, that if you pass `true` to the `Model::delete()` method it will completely delete the object from the database, which means that you can no longer restore it. Don't forget that you can save it again, though, as long as you don't clear or delete the PHP object.

```php
if ($objectUsingSoftDeletes->delete(true)) {
    echo 'The object has been hard deleted.';
    
    if ($objectUsingSoftDeletes->save()) {
        echo 'The object has been saved.';
    }
}
```

##### save
The `Model::save()` method saves the object to the database. Depending on the type of ID used for the model, and whether the object has already been persisted, the save method will call one of two internal methods, `Model::insert()` or `Model::upsert()`. You don't have to think about this yourself. Whether you just updated a single field, or if you just created the object from scratch and need to insert the whole thing, just call `save()` and let it do everything for you.

```php

$jedi = new Jedi('Anakin Skywalker');
$jedi->save(); // Saves the entire object

// Shit happens... Poor decisions are made...

$jedi->setName('Darth Vader');

$sith = $jedi;
unset($jedi);

$sith->save(); // Just saves the new value for the name field

```

#### Class Methods

##### count
This method returns the object count for the model. If you would like to count just a subset of the objects, you can add a filter to the count query.

```php
$totalCount     = Jedi::count();
$skywalkerCount = Jedi::count(['name' => ['$regex' => 'Skywalker']]);
```

##### deleteMany
This method deletes all objects that matches a given filter and then returns the number of objects that were deleted. The default filter is just an empty array, so if you don't pass your own filter, this method will delete all objects that are using this model.

```php
$yodasDeleted = Jedi::deleteMany(['name' => 'Yoda']);
$jedisDeleted = Jedi::deleteMany();
```

##### deleteOne
This method deletes the first object that matches a given filter and then returns the number of objects that were deleted (either 1 or 0). Just like with the `Model::deleteMany()` method, the filter defaults to an empty array, so if you want to delete a specific object you have to specify a filter.

```php
if (Jedi::deleteOne() === 1) {
    echo 'A Jedi was deleted.';
}

if (Jedi::deleteOne(['name' => 'Mace Windu']) === 1) {
    echo 'Mace Windu was deleted.';
}
```

##### find
This method finds all objects that matches a given filter. If you don't specify a filter, all objects will be returned.

```php
/**
 * @var Jedi[] $allJedis
 * @var Jedi[] $skywalkers
 */
$allJedis   = Jedi::find();
$skywalkers = Jedi::find(['name' => ['$regex' => 'Skywalker']]);
```

##### findById
This method finds an object by its primary ID. Usually this is a `MongoDB\BSON\ObjectID` object.

```php
/**
 * @var Jedi|null $yoda
 */
$yoda = Jedi::findById($yodasId);

if ($yoda === null) {
    echo 'Unable to find Master Yoda.';
}
```

##### findOne
This method works just like `Model::findById()`, except that you can match on anything and not just the primary ID. If you want to find a specific object, make sure to specify a filter.

```php
/**
 * @var Jedi|null $yoda
 */
$yoda = Jedi::findOne(['name' => 'Yoda']);

if ($yoda === null) {
    echo 'Unable to find Master Yoda.';
}
```
